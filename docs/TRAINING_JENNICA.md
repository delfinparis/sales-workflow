# Jennica's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You're the **hunter**. You find real estate agents who just achieved something great (closed a deal, got a new listing, etc.) and send them a quick congratulations text. That's it. You're opening the door so Ana can build relationships.

**Daily goal:** Send 20 personalized SMS messages to agents with real achievements.

## Getting Started (One-Time Setup)

### Tools You Need Open
1. **Monday.com** - [Your board link here]
2. **Courted.ai** - For finding superlatives
3. **JustCall** - For sending SMS

### Your Monday View
Click on **"🟣 Jennica's Day"** in the left sidebar. This shows only the leads you need to work.

---

## Your Daily Routine (30-45 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Your Tools (2 min)
```
□ Open Monday.com → Click "🟣 Jennica's Day" view
□ Open Courted.ai in another tab
□ Open JustCall (or have it ready)
```

### Step 2: Work Through Your List

For **each lead** in your view, do this:

#### A. Search in Courted (30 sec)
```
1. Copy the lead's name from Monday
2. Paste into Courted.ai search
3. Look for a SUPERLATIVE:
   - "Just closed on [address]!"
   - "New listing at [address]!"
   - "Year over year growth!"
   - "Top producer in [area]!"
```

#### B. Check Before You Text (10 sec)
**STOP and check these boxes in Monday:**
```
☐ "Do Not Contact" is UNCHECKED (if checked, skip them!)
☐ Status is "New Lead"
☐ You found a real superlative to mention
```

#### C. Send the SMS (30 sec)
```
1. Open JustCall
2. Find their phone number (from Monday)
3. Send this message (personalize it!):

   "Hey [First Name] - saw you just [their achievement].
    Amazing work! Congrats! - Ana @ Kale"

EXAMPLES:
- "Hey Sarah - saw you just closed on 123 Main St. Amazing work! Congrats! - Ana @ Kale"
- "Hey Mike - saw you got a new listing on Oak Ave. Looking great! Congrats! - Ana @ Kale"
- "Hey Lisa - saw your YoY growth numbers - crushing it! Congrats! - Ana @ Kale"
```

#### D. Update Monday (15 sec)
```
1. Change Status: "New Lead" → "SMS Sent"
2. Fill in "Superlative Type" (dropdown - pick what you saw)
3. That's it! Automations handle the rest.
```

### Step 3: Repeat Until You Hit 20

Work through your list until you've sent 20 SMS.

**Can't find 20 with superlatives?** That's okay. Quality over quantity. Only text people with REAL achievements to mention.

---

## What Happens After You Text

You don't need to track this - it's automatic:

| If they... | What happens | Who handles it |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Reply positively | Status → "Replied - Awaiting Ana" | Ana picks up |
| Don't reply (7 days) | Status → "30-Day Timeout" | Comes back to you later |
| Reply "stop/unsubscribe" | Status → "Dead - Negative Reply" | Gone for 1 year |

---

## Common Situations

### "I can't find them on Courted"
Skip them. Move to the next lead. Don't send a generic message.

### "They're on Courted but no recent superlative"
Skip them for now. They might get one later.

### "Do Not Contact is checked"
**NEVER** text them. Skip immediately.

### "Status isn't New Lead"
They're in someone else's workflow. Skip.

### "I already texted them before"
Check "Last Superlative Date" - if it's recent, skip. If it's months old AND they have a NEW superlative, you can text again.

### "They replied to me"
Great! Change status to "Replied - Awaiting Ana" and let Ana know. Don't continue the conversation yourself.

|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Status | Where they are | Change to "SMS Sent" after texting |
| Superlative Type | What they achieved | Select from dropdown |

### Columns To Check (Don't Update)
| Column | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Name / Phone | Their contact info | Use to find in Courted & JustCall |
| Do Not Contact | STOP sign | If checked, NEVER text them |
| Last Superlative Date | When you last found one | Skip if recent |
| Lead Source | Where they came from | FYI - shows if Courted, Event, etc. |

### Auto-Updated Columns (Ignore These)
| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| First Contact Date | Set automatically when you send SMS |
| Lead Score | Increases as they engage |
| Temperature | Cold→Warm→Hot as they progress |
| Stage Entry Date | Tracks when status changes |

**TIP:** You don't need to worry about most columns - just Status and Superlative Type!

## End of Day Checklist

```
□ Sent ~20 personalized SMS (or as many as had superlatives)
□ Each one has Status = "SMS Sent"
□ Each one has Superlative Type filled in
□ Didn't text anyone with "Do Not Contact" checked
□ Close Courted and JustCall
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Monday won't load | Refresh. If still broken, Slack DJ. |
| JustCall won't send | Check internet. Try again. If still broken, Slack DJ. |
| Courted is slow | Be patient. It's normal. |
| Someone replied angrily | Mark status "Dead - Negative Reply" and move on. |
| Not sure about something | Ask in Slack before guessing. |

## Remember

- You're sending **congratulations**, not sales pitches
- Sign as "Ana @ Kale" (not your name)
- Quality over quantity - 10 great messages > 20 generic ones
- When in doubt, skip the lead

**You're planting seeds. Ana waters them. DJ harvests.**
