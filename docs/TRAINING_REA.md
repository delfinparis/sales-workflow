# Rea's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You handle **newly licensed brokers** - people who just passed their real estate exam. They get imported from a monthly list, receive automated texts from Close CRM, and when they reply, YOU take over. Your job is to get them scheduled with DJ.

**Your goal:** Turn replies into appointments. Be fast, be helpful, be persistent.

---

## 🚨 SPEED IS EVERYTHING

**Respond to new replies within 5 MINUTES if possible.**

Why? Newly licensed agents are:
- Actively exploring options RIGHT NOW
- Likely texting multiple brokerages
- Making quick decisions about their first home
- Going with whoever responds first

**The first brokerage to call often wins.**

Studies show:
- Responding in 5 min = 9x more likely to convert than 30 min
- After 1 hour, their interest drops 80%
- By next day, they've often already chosen someone else

---

## Why This Works (The Psychology)

New agents are **nervous and overwhelmed**. They just passed their exam and have no idea what to do next. They need:

1. **Reassurance** → "You made a great decision getting licensed!"
2. **Guidance** → "Here's what happens next..."
3. **Speed** → Slow response = "they don't care about me"
4. **Low pressure** → They're already stressed, don't add to it

**Your superpower:** Being the helpful, fast-responding person who makes them feel taken care of.

## Success Metrics (What Good Looks Like)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Response time | < 5 min | Speed wins |
| Reply → Scheduled | 40-50% | Shows good urgency |
| Call attempts completed | 7 per lead | Persistence pays |
| No-show rate | < 20% | Good pre-qualification |

**Benchmark:** A good month = 10-15 appointments scheduled.

## Getting Started (One-Time Setup)

### Tools You Need Open
1. **Monday.com** - "Newly Licensed Leads" board
2. **Close CRM** - Where automated texts come from (you may need to check replies here)
3. **JustCall** - For manual SMS/calls
4. **Calendly** - DJ's meeting link

### Your Monday Board
Your board is **"Newly Licensed Leads"** with these groups:
- **Never Responded** - New imports, automated sequence running
- **Responded** - They replied! Your priority.
- **Scheduled Appointments** - Booked with DJ
- **Initially Responded, Then Disappeared** - Engaged once, then ghosted

---

## Your Daily Routine

### Priority Order (Work in This Order!)

```
🔥 PRIORITY 1: New replies in "Responded" group
   → These people JUST replied. Respond FAST!

📞 PRIORITY 2: Call attempts needed
   → People who didn't book after your Calendly text

⚠️ PRIORITY 3: Check "Initially Responded, Then Disappeared"
   → Try to re-engage ghosted leads

📋 PRIORITY 4: Week 3 - Call "Never Responded" leads
   → Manual outreach to people who never replied
```

---

## Working New Replies (Priority 1)

When someone shows up in the "Responded" group:

### Step 1: Read What They Said
```
1. Click on the lead in Monday
2. Check Close CRM or JustCall for their message
3. Note their tone - excited? skeptical? just curious?
```

### Step 2: Respond With Calendly Link
```
Your goal: Get them scheduled with DJ.

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
---
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for getting back to me!

Would love to set up a quick call with our broker DJ to answer any questions
about getting started. Here's his calendar - grab any time that works:

[Calendly Link]

What questions do you have so far?"
---
```

### Step 3: Update Monday
```
□ Status should already be "Replied" (automation)
□ If not, change it to "Replied"
□ Make sure they're in "Responded" group
□ Set "Next Action": "Wait for booking or follow up"
□ Set "Next Action Date": Tomorrow
```

---

## The Call Follow-Up Sequence (Priority 2)

**If they don't book within 24 hours after your Calendly text:**

Start calling. Every day for 7 days.

### Day 1-7 Call Script
```
WHEN THEY ANSWER:
"Hey [Name]! This is Rea from Kale Realty. I sent you a text
about setting up a call with our broker DJ. Do you have a quick
minute to find a time?"

→ If yes: Help them book via Calendly or pick a time verbally
→ If busy: "No problem! When's a better time to chat?"
→ If not interested: "Totally understand. What are you looking for
   in a brokerage?" (listen, then offer DJ call again)

WHEN YOU GET VOICEMAIL:
"Hey [Name], this is Rea from Kale Realty. Just following up on
my text about connecting with our broker DJ. Give me a call back
at [your number] or just reply to my text with a good time. Talk soon!"
```

### Tracking Call Attempts
```
After each call:
□ Update "Last Contact Date"
□ Add Note: "Call #1 - voicemail" or "Call #3 - spoke, will call back"
□ Set "Next Action Date" for tomorrow
```

### After 7 Days of Calls With No Response
```
□ Status → "Lost - No Response"
□ Add Note: "7 call attempts, no response"
□ They get added to event invite list for future
```

---

## Week 3: Calling "Never Responded" Leads (Priority 4)

Around the 3rd week of each month, manually call everyone in "Never Responded" who hasn't engaged.

### The Cold Call Script
```
"Hey [Name]! This is Rea from Kale Realty. I know you recently
got your license - congrats! I wanted to see if you had any
questions about getting started or finding the right brokerage?"

COMMON RESPONSES:
---
"Who is this?"
→ "I'm with Kale Realty - we reach out to newly licensed brokers
   to see if we can help. Have you found a brokerage yet?"
---
"I already have a brokerage"
→ "Awesome! How's it going so far? [listen] Well if anything
   changes, feel free to reach out. Good luck!"
→ Status → "Chose Another Firm"
---
"I'm still looking"
→ "Great! Would you be open to a quick call with our broker DJ?
   He can answer any questions and share what we offer."
→ If yes: Schedule via Calendly
---
"Not interested"
→ "No problem at all. Good luck with everything!"
→ Status → "Lost - No Response"
```

---

## Appointment Handling

### When They Book (Calendly)
```
Automation moves them to "Scheduled Appointments" group
Status → "Appointment Scheduled"
Your job: Done! DJ takes it from here.
```

### When They Complete the Appointment
```
Status → "Completed Appointment"
DJ updates the outcome
```

### When They No-Show
```
Status → "No Show"
YOU reach out to reschedule:

"Hey [Name]! Looks like we missed each other. No worries - want
to reschedule? Here's DJ's calendar again: [Calendly Link]"

□ If they reschedule → back to "Scheduled Appointments"
□ If they ghost again → Status → "Lost - No Response"
```

---

## New Agent Objection Handling

New agents have different concerns than experienced agents. Here's how to handle:

### "I don't know if I'm ready yet"
```
"That's totally normal! Most new agents feel that way. DJ's call
isn't about pressure - it's about helping you understand what
getting started looks like. What questions do you have?"
```

### "I'm still studying / haven't activated my license"
```
"Perfect timing then! This call is exactly for people in your
situation. DJ can explain what happens after you activate.
Want me to schedule it for after you're ready?"
```

### "I want to join a team, not a brokerage"
```
"We actually have teams here! DJ can talk you through what
working on a team looks like vs. going solo. Which sounds
more interesting to you?"
```

### "I'm just doing this part-time"
```
"Totally fine! Many of our agents started part-time. DJ can
share what that looks like and how to make it work with your
schedule. Sound good?"
```

### "My friend/family member is an agent, I'll join them"
```
"That's great you have someone to learn from! Just so you know,
you can join any brokerage regardless of where they are.
Want to at least hear what we offer so you can compare?"
```

### "I already talked to [competitor]"
```
"Nice! It's smart to explore options. We're pretty different
from most brokerages - worth a 15-min chat to compare.
What do you have to lose?"
```

---

## Special Situations

### They Already Joined Another Firm
```
"I already joined [Brokerage]"

1. Respond nicely: "Congrats! Hope it's going well for you!"
2. Status → "Chose Another Firm"
3. Set "Hibernation Until" → Today + 90 days
4. In 90 days: They'll come back for a check-in
```

### They Say "Stop" or "Leave Me Alone"
```
1. Respond: "No problem, removing you from our list. Good luck!"
2. Status → "Do Not Contact"
3. Check the "Do Not Contact" checkbox
4. NEVER contact them again
```

### They Responded Once, Then Disappeared
```
After 3+ days with no reply after booking attempt:
1. Move to "Initially Responded, Then Disappeared" group
2. Lower priority than active "Responded" leads
3. Try again in 1-2 weeks with a fresh approach
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't see their reply | Check Close CRM directly |
| Calendly not showing DJ's availability | DJ needs to update his calendar |
| They want to meet in person | "DJ can meet at our office - want me to set that up?" |
| They have questions I can't answer | "Great question! DJ can cover that in detail - let's get you scheduled." |
| Not sure which status to use | Ask DJ |

---

## Remember

- **Speed matters** - New leads go cold fast
- **Persistence pays** - 7 calls in 7 days
- **Be helpful, not pushy** - They're new and nervous
- **Document everything** - Notes help DJ prepare
- The goal is simple: **Reply → Call → Schedule**

**You're the bridge between "new license" and "Kale broker."**
