# Rea's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You handle **newly licensed brokers** - people who just passed their real estate exam. They get imported from a monthly list, receive automated texts from Close CRM, and when they reply, YOU take over. Your job is to get them scheduled with DJ.

**Your goal:** Turn replies into appointments. Be fast, be helpful, be persistent.

---

## Getting Started (One-Time Setup)

### Tools You Need Open
1. **Monday.com** - "Newly Licensed Leads" board
2. **Close CRM** - Where automated texts come from (you may need to check replies here)
3. **JustCall** - For manual SMS/calls
4. **Calendly** - DJ's meeting link

### Your Monday Board
Your board is **"Newly Licensed Leads"** with these groups:
- **Never Responded** - New imports, automated sequence running
- **Responded** - They replied! Your priority.
- **Scheduled Appointments** - Booked with DJ
- **Initially Responded, Then Disappeared** - Engaged once, then ghosted

---

## Your Daily Routine

### Priority Order (Work in This Order!)

```
🔥 PRIORITY 1: New replies in "Responded" group
   → These people JUST replied. Respond FAST!

📞 PRIORITY 2: Call attempts needed
   → People who didn't book after your Calendly text

⚠️ PRIORITY 3: Check "Initially Responded, Then Disappeared"
   → Try to re-engage ghosted leads

📋 PRIORITY 4: Week 3 - Call "Never Responded" leads
   → Manual outreach to people who never replied
```

---

## Working New Replies (Priority 1)

When someone shows up in the "Responded" group:

### Step 1: Read What They Said
```
1. Click on the lead in Monday
2. Check Close CRM or JustCall for their message
3. Note their tone - excited? skeptical? just curious?
```

### Step 2: Respond With Calendly Link
```
Your goal: Get them scheduled with DJ.

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
---
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for getting back to me!

Would love to set up a quick call with our broker DJ to answer any questions
about getting started. Here's his calendar - grab any time that works:

[Calendly Link]

What questions do you have so far?"
---
```

### Step 3: Update Monday
```
□ Status should already be "Replied" (automation)
□ If not, change it to "Replied"
□ Make sure they're in "Responded" group
□ Set "Next Action": "Wait for booking or follow up"
□ Set "Next Action Date": Tomorrow
```

---

## The Call Follow-Up Sequence (Priority 2)

**If they don't book within 24 hours after your Calendly text:**

Start calling. Every day for 7 days.

### Day 1-7 Call Script
```
WHEN THEY ANSWER:
"Hey [Name]! This is Rea from Kale Realty. I sent you a text
about setting up a call with our broker DJ. Do you have a quick
minute to find a time?"

→ If yes: Help them book via Calendly or pick a time verbally
→ If busy: "No problem! When's a better time to chat?"
→ If not interested: "Totally understand. What are you looking for
   in a brokerage?" (listen, then offer DJ call again)

WHEN YOU GET VOICEMAIL:
"Hey [Name], this is Rea from Kale Realty. Just following up on
my text about connecting with our broker DJ. Give me a call back
at [your number] or just reply to my text with a good time. Talk soon!"
```

### Tracking Call Attempts
```
After each call:
□ Update "Last Contact Date"
□ Add Note: "Call #1 - voicemail" or "Call #3 - spoke, will call back"
□ Set "Next Action Date" for tomorrow
```

### After 7 Days of Calls With No Response
```
□ Status → "Lost - No Response"
□ Add Note: "7 call attempts, no response"
□ They get added to event invite list for future
```

---

## Week 3: Calling "Never Responded" Leads (Priority 4)

Around the 3rd week of each month, manually call everyone in "Never Responded" who hasn't engaged.

### The Cold Call Script
```
"Hey [Name]! This is Rea from Kale Realty. I know you recently
got your license - congrats! I wanted to see if you had any
questions about getting started or finding the right brokerage?"

COMMON RESPONSES:
---
"Who is this?"
→ "I'm with Kale Realty - we reach out to newly licensed brokers
   to see if we can help. Have you found a brokerage yet?"
---
"I already have a brokerage"
→ "Awesome! How's it going so far? [listen] Well if anything
   changes, feel free to reach out. Good luck!"
→ Status → "Chose Another Firm"
---
"I'm still looking"
→ "Great! Would you be open to a quick call with our broker DJ?
   He can answer any questions and share what we offer."
→ If yes: Schedule via Calendly
---
"Not interested"
→ "No problem at all. Good luck with everything!"
→ Status → "Lost - No Response"
```

---

## Appointment Handling

### When They Book (Calendly)
```
Automation moves them to "Scheduled Appointments" group
Status → "Appointment Scheduled"
Your job: Done! DJ takes it from here.
```

### When They Complete the Appointment
```
Status → "Completed Appointment"
DJ updates the outcome
```

### When They No-Show
```
Status → "No Show"
YOU reach out to reschedule:

"Hey [Name]! Looks like we missed each other. No worries - want
to reschedule? Here's DJ's calendar again: [Calendly Link]"

□ If they reschedule → back to "Scheduled Appointments"
□ If they ghost again → Status → "Lost - No Response"
```

---

## Special Situations

### They Already Joined Another Firm
```
"I already joined [Brokerage]"

1. Respond nicely: "Congrats! Hope it's going well for you!"
2. Status → "Chose Another Firm"
3. Set "Hibernation Until" → Today + 90 days
4. In 90 days: They'll come back for a check-in
```

### They Say "Stop" or "Leave Me Alone"
```
1. Respond: "No problem, removing you from our list. Good luck!"
2. Status → "Do Not Contact"
3. Check the "Do Not Contact" checkbox
4. NEVER contact them again
```

### They Responded Once, Then Disappeared
```
After 3+ days with no reply after booking attempt:
1. Move to "Initially Responded, Then Disappeared" group
2. Lower priority than active "Responded" leads
3. Try again in 1-2 weeks with a fresh approach
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't see their reply | Check Close CRM directly |
| Calendly not showing DJ's availability | DJ needs to update his calendar |
| They want to meet in person | "DJ can meet at our office - want me to set that up?" |
| They have questions I can't answer | "Great question! DJ can cover that in detail - let's get you scheduled." |
| Not sure which status to use | Ask DJ |

---

## Remember

- **Speed matters** - New leads go cold fast
- **Persistence pays** - 7 calls in 7 days
- **Be helpful, not pushy** - They're new and nervous
- **Document everything** - Notes help DJ prepare
- The goal is simple: **Reply → Call → Schedule**

**You're the bridge between "new license" and "Kale broker."**
