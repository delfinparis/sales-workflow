# Ana's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You're the **relationship builder**. Jennica finds agents and sends the first text. When they reply, YOU take over. Your job is to build a genuine relationship, offer them value (tools, training), and eventually ask if they've ever thought about joining another brokerage. If they say yes, you schedule them with DJ.

**Daily goal:** Respond to every new reply within 4 hours. Keep conversations moving forward.

## Getting Started (One-Time Setup)

### Tools You Need Open

2. **JustCall** - For SMS conversations

## Working New Replies (Priority 1)

When someone new shows up in "Replied - Awaiting Ana":

### Step 1: Read Their Reply
```
1. Click on the lead in Monday
2. Check the Updates section or JustCall for their message
3. Note: What did they say? What's their tone?
```

### Step 2: Check Their Context
```
Look at these columns:
□ Superlative Type - What did Jennica congratulate them on?
□ Deal Count - How active are they?
□ Notes - Any previous context?
□ Current Tasks - AI-suggested responses (if populated)
```

### Step 3: Respond Warmly
```
Your response should:
✓ Acknowledge what they said
✓ Be warm and personal (not salesy)
✓ Offer something of value OR ask a question

GOOD EXAMPLES:
---
Them: "Thanks! Yeah it was a tough one but we closed!"
You: "That's awesome - those tough ones feel even better when they close!
      How long was that one in the works?"
---
Them: "Who is this?"
You: "Hey! I'm Ana with Kale Realty. Saw your closed sale and just wanted
      to say congrats! We love celebrating agent wins. How's business going for you?"
---
Them: "Thanks, how did you find me?"
You: "We use a tool that highlights agent achievements - yours popped up!
      Just like to connect with successful agents in the area. What's your focus right now - buyers or sellers?"
```

### Step 4: Update Monday
```
□ Change Status: "Replied - Awaiting Ana" → "Ana Engaged"
□ Update "Last Contact Date" (may be automatic)
□ Set "Next Action" (e.g., "Wait for reply" or "Follow up if no response")
□ Set "Next Action Date" (2-3 days out if waiting)
□ Add a quick Note if there's important context
```

Goal: Find their pain points, build trust

CONVERSATION STARTERS:
- "How's the market treating you lately?"

```

### Phase 4: The Ask
```

THE ASK (when the time is right):
"You know, you seem like someone who really takes their business seriously.
Have you ever thought about exploring other brokerage options?"

RESPONSES:
---
"Yes, actually!" →
   "That's great! Would you be open to a quick call with our broker DJ?
    He can share what we offer - no pressure, just info."
   If yes → Schedule via Calendly, Status → "Meeting Scheduled"
---
"Maybe, I'm not sure" →
   "Totally get it. What would you need to see to even consider it?"
   Keep building relationship
---
"No, I'm happy where I am" →
   "That's awesome - sounds like you found a good fit!
    Well, feel free to reach out if anything changes."
   Status → "Hibernation 90-Day"
```
