# Ana's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You're the **relationship builder**. Jennica finds agents and sends the first text. When they reply, YOU take over. Your job is to build a genuine relationship, offer them value (tools, training), and eventually ask if they've ever thought about joining another brokerage. If they say yes, you schedule them with DJ.

**Daily goal:** Respond to every new reply within 4 hours. Keep conversations moving forward.

---

## Why This Works (The Psychology)

Real estate agents get pitched constantly. They're skeptical of anyone who seems "salesy." Our approach works because:

1. **We lead with congratulations, not a pitch** → They feel seen, not targeted
2. **We offer value before asking for anything** → Builds trust and reciprocity
3. **We're patient** → Most recruiters give up after 1-2 touches; we nurture for weeks
4. **We listen for pain** → We don't create problems; we help solve ones they already have

**The typical journey takes 2-4 weeks** from first reply to scheduling with DJ. Don't rush it. The agents who feel genuinely cared for become the best recruits.

### Your Mindset
- You're not "selling" - you're **helping agents find a better situation**
- Rejection isn't personal - it's about timing and fit
- Every "no" is a "not yet" - they may come back in 90 days
- You're building **relationships**, not closing deals

## Success Metrics (What Good Looks Like)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Response time | < 4 hours | Speed builds trust |
| Reply → Ana Engaged | 80%+ | Shows good first response |
| Tool acceptance rate | 60%+ | Shows value is compelling |
| Ask Made → Meeting | 30-40% | Shows good qualification |
| Ghost rate | < 20% | Shows good engagement |

**Benchmark:** A good month = 5-10 meetings scheduled from your conversations.

---

## Your Daily Routine

### Priority Order (Work in This Order!)

```
🔥 PRIORITY 1: New replies ("Replied - Awaiting Ana")
   → These people JUST replied. Respond within 4 hours!

📅 PRIORITY 2: Scheduled follow-ups (Next Action Date = Today)
   → People you planned to reach out to today

⚠️ PRIORITY 3: Stale leads (7+ days no contact)
   → Don't let conversations die
```

---

## Working New Replies (Priority 1)

When someone new shows up in "Replied - Awaiting Ana":

### Step 1: Read Their Reply
```
1. Click on the lead in Monday
2. Check the Updates section or JustCall for their message
3. Note: What did they say? What's their tone?
```

### Step 2: Check Their Context
```
Look at these columns:
□ Superlative Type - What did Jennica congratulate them on?
□ Deal Count - How active are they?
□ Notes - Any previous context?
□ Current Tasks - AI-suggested responses (if populated)
```

### Step 3: Respond Warmly
```
Your response should:
✓ Acknowledge what they said
✓ Be warm and personal (not salesy)
✓ Offer something of value OR ask a question
✓ Match their energy level (short reply = short response)

GOOD EXAMPLES:
---
Them: "Thanks! Yeah it was a tough one but we closed!"
You: "That's awesome - those tough ones feel even better when they close!
      How long was that one in the works?"
---
Them: "Who is this?"
You: "Hey! I'm Ana with Kale Realty. Saw your closed sale and just wanted
      to say congrats! We love celebrating agent wins. How's business going for you?"
---
Them: "Thanks, how did you find me?"
You: "We use a tool that highlights agent achievements - yours popped up!
      Just like to connect with successful agents in the area. What's your focus right now - buyers or sellers?"

❌ BAD EXAMPLES (Don't Do This):
---
Them: "Thanks!"
You: "You're welcome! So have you ever thought about switching brokerages?
      We have great splits and culture!"
→ WAY too fast. You just met them!
---
Them: "Who is this?"
You: "I'm with Kale Realty and we're looking for top producers to join our team.
      Can I tell you about our commission structure?"
→ Sounds like a cold pitch. They'll ghost.
---
Them: "How's business?"
You: "Great! Hey so do you have time for a call this week?"
→ Didn't answer their question. Pushy.
```

### Step 4: Update Monday
```
□ Change Status: "Replied - Awaiting Ana" → "Ana Engaged"
□ Update "Last Contact Date" (may be automatic)
□ Set "Next Action" (e.g., "Wait for reply" or "Follow up if no response")
□ Set "Next Action Date" (2-3 days out if waiting)
□ Add a quick Note if there's important context
```

## The Relationship Flow

Here's how conversations typically progress:

### Phase 1: Initial Engagement
```
Status: "Ana Engaged"
Goal: Get them talking, find common ground
Topics: Their recent success, market conditions, what they're working on
```

### Phase 2: Offer Value
```
Status: "Tool Offered" or "Training Invited"
Goal: Give them something useful

TOOL OFFERING:
"By the way, I put together a collection of ChatGPT prompts specifically
for real estate - stuff like listing descriptions, buyer follow-ups, etc.
Want me to send it over?"

If yes:
□ Send the tool link
□ Send a voice memo introducing yourself (see script below)
□ Check "Voice Memo Sent" box
□ Status → "Tool Offered"
□ Set follow-up for 2-4 days

VOICE MEMO SCRIPT (30-45 seconds):
---
"Hey [Name]! It's Ana from Kale Realty. Just wanted to put a voice
to the texts! [laugh] I just sent over those AI prompts - I think
you'll really like the listing description one, it's been a game changer
for our agents. Anyway, let me know what you think after you play
with it! Talk soon!"
---
Keep it warm, natural, like you're texting a friend. Don't sound scripted.

TRAINING INVITATION:
"We do a free Thursday training on [topic] - no pitch, just good info.
Interested?"

If yes:
□ Send the training details
□ Status → "Training Invited"
```

### Phase 3: Relationship Building
```
Status: "Relationship Building"
Goal: Find their pain points, build trust

CONVERSATION STARTERS:
- "How's the market treating you lately?"
- "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
- "What would make your business easier?"
- "If you could change one thing about how you work, what would it be?"

Listen for:
⚠️ Complaints about their current brokerage
⚠️ Frustrations with splits/fees
⚠️ Feeling unsupported
⚠️ Wanting more training/tools
⚠️ Mentioning they've thought about switching

READING BETWEEN THE LINES:
---
They say: "It's been a tough year"
They mean: Possible financial stress, may be open to better splits

They say: "My broker doesn't really do much"
They mean: Feeling unsupported, wants more leadership

They say: "I'm basically running my own business"
They mean: Not getting value for their fees

They say: "I've been thinking about what's next"
They mean: Open to change, perfect time for the ask

They say: "I just do my own thing"
They mean: Independent, may resist structure OR may be lonely
---

CAPTURE PAIN POINTS:
When they mention frustrations, update these columns:
□ Pain Points - Write what they said (exact words if possible)
□ Current Split - If they mention their split (e.g., "70/30")
□ Trigger Event - Select what triggered their frustration:
  - Bad Month, Lost a Deal, Fee Increase, Agent Left,
    Management Change, Looking for Growth, Tool/Tech Need
```

### Phase 4: The Ask
```
Status: "Ask Made"
Goal: See if they're open to exploring options

THE ASK (when the time is right):
"You know, you seem like someone who really takes their business seriously.
Have you ever thought about exploring other brokerage options?"

RESPONSES:
---
"Yes, actually!" →
   "That's great! Would you be open to a quick call with our broker DJ?
    He can share what we offer - no pressure, just info."
   If yes → Schedule via Calendly, Status → "Meeting Scheduled"
---
"Maybe, I'm not sure" →
   "Totally get it. What would you need to see to even consider it?"
   Keep building relationship
---
"No, I'm happy where I am" →
   "That's awesome - sounds like you found a good fit!
    Well, feel free to reach out if anything changes."
   Status → "Hibernation 90-Day"
```
