# DJ's Daily Training Guide

## Your Role in 30 Seconds

You're the **closer**. Ana builds relationships and identifies agents open to switching. When they're ready, YOU take over. Your job is to meet with them, understand their needs, present Kale's value, extend offers, and sign new brokers.

**Daily goal:** Prepare for meetings, conduct meetings, follow up on offers, close deals.

---

## Success Metrics (What Good Looks Like)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Meeting → Offer Extended | 60-70% | Shows good qualification by Ana |
| Offer → Signed | 30-40% | Industry standard for recruiting |
| Average days to close | 14-21 days | Speed matters, but don't rush |
| No-show rate | < 15% | Low = good pre-qualification |
| Follow-up completion | 100% | Consistency wins |

**Benchmark:** A good month = 3-5 signed agents from your pipeline.

```

```
Based on their pain points, prepare to address:

□ If support is an issue → Highlight our training/mentorship
□ If technology is an issue → Show our tech stack

```

## During the Meeting

### Opening (5 min)
```
"Hey [Name]! Great to finally connect. Ana's told me great things
about you. Before I dive in, I'd love to hear - what made you
interested in chatting today?"

Listen carefully. Take notes.
```

### Discovery (15-20 min)
```
KEY QUESTIONS:
• "Tell me about your current situation at [Brokerage]"
• "What's working well for you there?"
• "What would you change if you could?"
• "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
• "What would your ideal brokerage look like?"

LISTEN FOR:
⚠️ Specific frustrations (capture these!)
⚠️ Goals they're not achieving
⚠️ Support they're not getting
⚠️ Money they're leaving on the table
```

### Present Value (10-15 min)
```
Match Kale's offerings to THEIR specific needs:

If they want better splits:
→ "At Kale, our structure is [X]. Based on your volume, that means..."

If they want more support:
→ "We have [specific program]. For example, [story of agent who benefited]..."

If they want better tech:
→ "Let me show you what we use for [their pain point]..."

If they want growth:
→ "Here's how we help agents grow their business..."
```

### Handle Objections
```
Common objections and responses:

"I need to think about it"
→ "Totally understand. What specifically would you want to think through?
   Maybe I can help clarify."

"I'm talking to other brokerages"
→ "Smart to explore your options. What are you liking about them?
   Let's make sure you're comparing apples to apples."

"The timing isn't right"
→ "When would be better timing? What would need to change?"
   (Set follow-up for that time)

"I'm worried about leaving my clients"
→ "Your clients are yours. Here's how the transition works..."

"What if it doesn't work out?"
→ "Here's our track record with agents like you... [success stories]"
```

### Close or Next Step (5 min)
```
IF THEY'RE READY:
"Based on everything we discussed, I think you'd be a great fit.
I'd love to put together an offer for you. Can I send that over today?"

IF THEY NEED TIME:
"Totally get it. What would be helpful for you to make a decision?
Can we schedule a follow-up call for [specific date]?"

IF THEY'RE NOT READY:
"No pressure at all. Let's stay in touch - I'll check in with you
in [timeframe]. Does that work?"
```

## Competitor Battle Cards

When they mention a competitor, here's how to position:

### vs. Compass
```
Their pitch: Tech platform, brand recognition, stock options
Our counter:
→ "Compass is great for marketing, but how's the actual support?
   Many agents tell us they feel like a number there."
→ "Their tech is slick, but do you actually use it all?"
→ "Stock options sound great until you read the fine print..."

Key advantage: Personal attention, actually knowing your broker
```

### vs. @properties
```
Their pitch: Local brand, Christie's connection, strong culture
Our counter:
→ "Great company! What specifically draws you to them?"
→ Focus on splits - they're often lower than Kale
→ "How accessible is leadership there?"

Key advantage: More competitive splits, equally strong training
```

### vs. eXp Realty
```
Their pitch: Revenue share, virtual model, stock
Our counter:
→ "The revenue share sounds great - how many people do you
   actually know who make real money from it?"
→ "Virtual is fine, but do you have someone to call when
   a deal is falling apart at 9pm?"
→ "What happens to your revenue share if they leave?"

Key advantage: Physical presence, real mentorship, no recruiting pressure
```

### vs. Staying Put
```
Their pitch: "I know my broker, it's comfortable, why change?"
Our counter:
→ "That makes total sense. What would have to change for you
   to even consider looking around?"
→ "If you could design your perfect situation, what would it look like?"
→ "Are you growing the way you want to be?"

Key advantage: Plant seeds, stay in touch, they may come back
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Lead went cold after hot meeting | Check in - life happens. Offer flexibility. |
| They keep rescheduling | "I want to respect both our time. Is this still something you're interested in?" |
| They're comparing to competitor | Use battle card above. Stay curious, not defensive. |
| They want things we can't offer | Be honest. Better to lose now than have unhappy agent later. |
| They signed with competitor | "Congrats! If things don't work out, door is always open." Set win-back date. |

## Remember

- **Preparation wins** - Know their story before the call
- **Listen more than you talk** - They should do 60% of talking
- **Match value to needs** - Don't pitch features, solve problems
- **Follow up consistently** - Most deals close on follow-up 3-7
- **Know when to let go** - Not every lead is a fit, and that's okay
- **Celebrate wins** - And share credit with Ana and Jennica!

**Jennica plants seeds. Ana waters them. You harvest.**
