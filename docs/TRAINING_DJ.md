## Before Each Meeting (15 min prep)

### Step 1: Review the Lead
```
Open their Monday item and check:
□ Notes - What has Ana learned about them?
□ Pain Points - What frustrations have they mentioned?
□ Current Split - What are they getting now?
□ Trigger Event - What made them interested?
□ Competitor Name - Are they considering anyone else?
□ Deal Count - How productive are they?
□ Current Brokerage - Where are they now?
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Approach
```
Based on their pain points, prepare to address:
□ If splits are an issue → Know our split structure
□ If support is an issue → Highlight our training/mentorship
□ If technology is an issue → Show our tech stack
□ If culture is an issue → Share team stories
□ If growth is an issue → Discuss business development support
```

### Step 3: Check the Box
```
□ Check "Meeting Prep Done" in Monday
```

## During the Meeting

### Opening (5 min)
```
"Hey [Name]! Great to finally connect. Ana's told me great things
about you. Before I dive in, I'd love to hear - what made you
interested in chatting today?"

Listen carefully. Take notes.
```

### Discovery (15-20 min)
```
KEY QUESTIONS:
• "Tell me about your current situation at [Brokerage]"
• "What's working well for you there?"
• "What would you change if you could?"
• "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
• "What would your ideal brokerage look like?"

LISTEN FOR:
⚠️ Specific frustrations (capture these!)
⚠️ Goals they're not achieving
⚠️ Support they're not getting
⚠️ Money they're leaving on the table
```

### Present Value (10-15 min)
```
Match Kale's offerings to THEIR specific needs:

If they want better splits:
→ "At Kale, our structure is [X]. Based on your volume, that means..."

If they want more support:
→ "We have [specific program]. For example, [story of agent who benefited]..."

If they want better tech:
→ "Let me show you what we use for [their pain point]..."

If they want growth:
→ "Here's how we help agents grow their business..."
```

### Handle Objections
```
Common objections and responses:

"I need to think about it"
→ "Totally understand. What specifically would you want to think through?
   Maybe I can help clarify."

"I'm talking to other brokerages"
→ "Smart to explore your options. What are you liking about them?
   Let's make sure you're comparing apples to apples."

"The timing isn't right"
→ "When would be better timing? What would need to change?"
   (Set follow-up for that time)

"I'm worried about leaving my clients"
→ "Your clients are yours. Here's how the transition works..."

"What if it doesn't work out?"
→ "Here's our track record with agents like you... [success stories]"
```

### Close or Next Step (5 min)
```
IF THEY'RE READY:
"Based on everything we discussed, I think you'd be a great fit.
I'd love to put together an offer for you. Can I send that over today?"

IF THEY NEED TIME:
"Totally get it. What would be helpful for you to make a decision?
Can we schedule a follow-up call for [specific date]?"

IF THEY'RE NOT READY:
"No pressure at all. Let's stay in touch - I'll check in with you
in [timeframe]. Does that work?"
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Lead went cold after hot meeting | Check in - life happens. Offer flexibility. |
| They keep rescheduling | "I want to respect both our time. Is this still something you're interested in?" |
| They're comparing to competitor | "What would help you make the best decision for yourself?" |
| They want things we can't offer | Be honest. Better to lose now than have unhappy agent later. |
| They signed with competitor | "Congrats! If things don't work out, door is always open." Set win-back date. |

## Remember

- **Preparation wins** - Know their story before the call
- **Listen more than you talk** - They should do 60% of talking
- **Match value to needs** - Don't pitch features, solve problems
- **Follow up consistently** - Most deals close on follow-up 3-7
- **Know when to let go** - Not every lead is a fit, and that's okay
- **Celebrate wins** - And share credit with Ana and Jennica!

**Jennica plants seeds. Ana waters them. You harvest.**
