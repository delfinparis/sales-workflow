## Three Places for Notes

| Location | What Goes Here | Who Writes | When |
|----------|----------------|------------|------|
| **Updates** (activity log) | Conversation events, status changes, automated logs | Automations + Manual | Ongoing |
| **Notes** column | Manual observations, personal insights | Ana, DJ | As needed |
| **AI Meeting Notes** column | AI-generated meeting summaries | MeetGeek / Gemini | After meetings |

---

## Updates (Activity Log)

The Updates section in Monday (click on an item to see it) is your **conversation timeline**.

**What goes here:**
- ✅ Auto-logged status changes ("30-Day Timeout Started")
- ✅ Auto-logged contact events ("Reply received from JustCall")
- ✅ Email thread summaries from Instantly
- ✅ Meeting scheduled/rescheduled notifications
- ✅ Quick notes during a call ("They mentioned being unhappy with splits")

**Who uses it:**
- Automations write most of this
- Ana/DJ can add quick notes during conversations

**How to use:**
- Scroll to see full history
- Use @mentions to notify team members
- Can attach files if needed

---

## Notes Column

The Notes column is for **manual observations and insights**.

**What goes here:**
- ✅ "Seems very interested in team-building support"
- ✅ "Mentioned they have a family event in June - follow up after"
- ✅ "Referred by John Smith"
- ✅ "Be careful - they're sensitive about commission questions"
- ✅ "Great rapport - very chatty, likes sports"

**Who uses it:**
- Ana (relationship insights)
- DJ (meeting observations)

**What does NOT go here:**
- ❌ Conversation transcripts (too long)
- ❌ Automated messages (use Updates)
- ❌ Meeting summaries (use AI Meeting Notes)

---

## AI Meeting Notes Column

The AI Meeting Notes column is for **automated meeting summaries** only.

**What goes here:**
- ✅ MeetGeek-generated meeting summary
- ✅ Google Gemini meeting notes
- ✅ Auto-extracted action items

**Who uses it:**
- Written by: AI tool (automated)
- Read by: DJ (to review), Ana (for context)

**Important:**
- This gets overwritten if there's a second meeting
- If multiple meetings occur, previous notes should be copied to Updates before the next meeting

---

## Current Tasks Column

The Current Tasks column is for **contextual prompts and checklists**.

**What goes here:**
- ✅ Ana's response templates (when lead replies)
- ✅ Tool offering checklist (when status = Tool Offered)
- ✅ DJ's meeting prep questions (when status = Meeting Scheduled)
- ✅ Instantly lead intro tasks

**Who uses it:**
- Written by: Automations (based on status)
- Read by: Ana, DJ (as guidance)

**Important:**
- This content changes based on status
- It's a **prompt**, not a **record**
- Don't rely on it for history - it gets overwritten

## Quick Reference: Where Do I Put This?

| Scenario | Where to Put It |
|----------|-----------------|
| Lead mentioned their kid's birthday is next week | Notes column |
| They replied "Thanks for the congrats!" | Updates (auto-logged by JustCall integration) |
| AI summary of DJ's recruiting meeting | AI Meeting Notes column |
| "This lead seems hesitant about leaving current brokerage" | Notes column |
| Status changed to Tool Offered | Updates (auto-logged) |
| DJ's prep questions for upcoming meeting | Current Tasks (auto-populated) |
| "They asked about Kale's commission structure" | Updates (quick note during call) |
| "Great call - they're definitely interested" | Notes column |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Notes column concise** - It's for insights, not transcripts
2. **Use Updates for real-time notes** - During calls, jot quick notes in Updates
3. **Review AI Meeting Notes** - Always read the AI summary, but don't edit it
4. **Don't duplicate** - If it's auto-logged, don't manually write it again
5. **Use @mentions** - Tag team members in Updates when handoffs happen
