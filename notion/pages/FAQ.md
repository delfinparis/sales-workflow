## 🟣 Jennica's Questions

### Finding Leads

**Q: What if I can't find someone on Courted.ai?**
> Skip them and move to the next lead. Don't send a generic message - quality over quantity.

**Q: What if they're on Courted but have no recent superlative?**
> Skip them for now. They might get one later and come back into your view.

**Q: Can I text someone I've texted before?**
> Check the "Last Superlative Date" column. If it's months old AND they have a NEW achievement, you can text again with the new superlative.

### Sending Messages

**Q: What if "Do Not Contact" is checked?**
> NEVER text them. Skip immediately. This is critical.

**Q: Should I sign my own name or Ana's?**
> Always sign as "Ana @ Kale" - this is intentional so Ana can continue the conversation.

**Q: What if someone replies to me directly?**
> Great! Change status to "Replied - Awaiting Ana" and let Ana know. Don't continue the conversation yourself.

## 🔵 Ana's Questions

### Response Timing

**Q: How quickly should I respond to new replies?**
> Within 4 hours maximum. The faster the better - speed matters in sales.

**Q: What if I can't respond within 4 hours?**
> Even a quick "Hey! Got your message, will send more details shortly!" is better than silence.

### Conversations

**Q: What if they ask about commission/splits?**
> Say: "Great question! DJ can cover all the specifics - want me to set up a quick call?"

**Q: What if they're rude but don't say "stop"?**
> Stay professional. If it gets really bad, mark as "Dead - Negative Reply" and move on.

**Q: When should I make "the ask"?**
> When the relationship feels natural - usually after offering tools and having 2-3 good exchanges where they've opened up about their situation.

**Q: What if they mention they're talking to a competitor?**
> Don't panic! Say "Oh nice! What's drawing you to them?" Listen, take notes, and offer a comparison chat with DJ.

### Pain Points

**Q: What counts as a "pain point"?**
> Anything they complain about: bad splits, lack of support, poor technology, management issues, feeling stuck, etc.

**Q: How do I capture pain points?**
> Use their exact words when possible. Write in the "Pain Points" column and select the "Trigger Event" dropdown.

### Ghosting

**Q: What if they stop responding?**
> After 7 days: Send a gentle follow-up
> After 14 days total: Move to "30-Day Timeout"

**Q: How do I know if someone is at risk of ghosting?**
> Check the "Ghost Risk" column. It auto-updates based on how long since their last meaningful reply.

## 🟢 Rea's Questions

### Call Follow-ups

**Q: How many days should I call before giving up?**
> 7 days of call attempts. After that, mark "Lost - No Response"

**Q: What if they answer but say "not now"?**
> Ask when would be a better time. If they're vague, set a follow-up for 2 weeks.

**Q: What do I say in voicemails?**
> "Hey [Name], this is Rea from Kale Realty. Just following up on my text about connecting with our broker DJ. Give me a call at [number] or reply to my text. Talk soon!"

### Scheduling

**Q: What if they want to meet in person instead of video?**
> "DJ can meet at our office - want me to set that up?" Then coordinate with DJ.

**Q: What if Calendly shows no availability?**
> DJ needs to update his calendar. Message him in Slack.

### Special Cases

**Q: What if they already joined another brokerage?**
> Say congrats, change status to "Chose Another Firm", fill in which firm, and set Hibernation for 90 days.

**Q: What if they're interested but say they need more time?**
> "Totally understand! Want me to check back in a few weeks?" Set Next Action Date accordingly.
